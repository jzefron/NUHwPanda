    "* There are two dramatically different types of schools in this district: Large district schools and small charter schools. The largest charter school is around 2300 students and the smallest district school is around 2800 students. The charter schools outperform the district schools based on the specified criteria. \n",
    "* More analysis needs to be done on the reading scores. A difference of 2 points on an average score leads to a dramatically different result on the passing rate.\n",
    "* There is a dramatic difference in the district schools performance in math and reading. While around 81% of students pass the reading section, 67% of students pass the math. \n",
    "* Scores seem are mostly stable across grades. They do not significantly change.\n",
